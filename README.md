# Introduction

This project builds a javascript equality table (similar to [this](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/)) using Vue.js

**[See it live](https://rawgit.com/userpixel/js-operators-table/master/index.html)**

It doesn't have any build step and is supposed to be served directly using Github pages.

# Running it locally

Install dependencies and run it like a normal server:

````
npm i
npm start
````

This uses `live-reload` to load on any change.

All live-reload switches are accessible
for example if you want to force run it on Chrome do `npm start -- --browser=google\ chrome`.
